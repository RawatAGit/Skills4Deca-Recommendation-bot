While design for disassembly principles can be applied for new buildings under design, there seems to be notable reuse potential of various structural and/or building envelope elements stored in existing buildings, considered to be material bank for urban mining. According to 9R circular construction principles, refuse, rethink and reduce is a way to go, followed by renovation. If demolition is inevitable, reuse of components should be preferred. Remanufacture or recycling of building materials from existing buildings becomes an option, if reuse is complicated. Instead of business as usual demolition, existing buildings should be analysed against possible adaptions of functionality as well as various renovation scenario. Pre-demolition auditing should be carried out in order assess reuse potential of its elements or recycling of materials.

      "description": "The European Green Deal is the EU's growth and recovery strategy that aims to transform Europe into the first climate-neutral bloc by 2050. Energy efficiency is a key area of action, without which the full decarbonisation of the EU economy cannot be achieved. Within this context, energy efficiency investments need to be increased in all sectors of the economy. This is the most cost-effective and sustainable way towards climate neutrality. The decarbonisation of the housing stock will make it safer, more affordable and accessible. The study course provides knowledge about the housing decarbonisation and energy management, its basics, different aspects, energy efficiency measures, benefits, problems and improvement possibilities in the building sector, the role of local authorities in energy efficiency issues, as well as financial instruments to support energy efficient projects.",
